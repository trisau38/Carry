# Carry
## adder.v
     This program code takes in input in the form of A, B, C where A and B are input bits and C is the carry bit and calculates its sum and carry.
     The sum is stored in S and the carry is stored in Cy which are assigned as outputs.
     This program is expressed in terms of boolean expressions.
